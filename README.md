# Google Earth Engine Images Batch Download

## Motivation:

Google Earth Engine provides us with huge amount of geospatial data which can be visulized well on Google Earth Engine Web Platform, but when it comes to exporting image, GEE has limited in batch processing. Developed by Puzhao Zhang [@Puzhao89](https://github.com/puzhao89) originally, a GEE batch download algorithm is now available based on GEE Python API.
